### Head first Design Principles

* Chapter 1 finished
* undestand strategy pattern:
  * extract out 'behaviors' that vary of an object and create 'behavior'/algorithm classes that implement that behavior in the different ways that are required.
  * then use that behavior interface in the main class to be able to dynamically assign behaviors from the client code

### Programming Rust

* Chapters 1-4 finished
* understand somewhat about rust's memory model
  * how each variable name owns a value
  * for another data structure/control structure to be able to read/write that value, it needs to either borrow the value (through a reference) or take ownership of the value (move)
* dont really understand lifetimes, need to read/play with it on computer

### Functional programming in Scala

* Chapters 1-5? finished
* understand maps filters reduces, hof, the Option type and the Result type
